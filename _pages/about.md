Hello, welcome to my page! I am a PhD candidate in [Industrial Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/graduate/degrees-and-programs/phd-industrial-engineering) at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Industrial & Enterprise Systems Department with a statistics minor. I'm advised by Professor [Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2018.

### Research Interest
 My research focuses on design for sustainability and its integration with lifecycle decisions (e.g., maintenance, inventory management, remanufacturing). Leveraging tools and concepts from optimization, predictive modeling, and uncertainty quantification, I’m seeking to provide methodologies and practical solutions to achieve sustainability goals in a closed‑loop supply chain.
